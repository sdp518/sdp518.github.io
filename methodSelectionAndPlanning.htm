									We have decided to use the agile software engineering method Scrum. 
									It provides us with a method that gives us flexibility in our implementation of requirements that will allow us to be adaptable as the climate of the project changes, 
									whilst also implementing a sprint system that will help to ensure a functioning increment of the program always exists. 
									On top of this, it minimizes formal roles to simply the Scrum Master and the Project Owner. 
									The only other formal role we have added in addition to this is a team leader, instead opting for the most flexible working environment possible.
